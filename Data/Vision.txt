__________________ VISION _& MISSION____________________




APAIA TECHNOLOGY vision of the technology:
Generative AI, which development follows a typical disruptive innovation curve, 
has entered the acceleration phase since 2019 with 5 key drivers :
•	Platform industrialization
•	Mix of expert architecture
•	Spreading of transformer architecture to computer vision
•	Access and tailored applications development
•	Calculation capacity continuous increase
Genarative AI relies on 3 articulated stacks:
•	IT infrastructure for inference
•	Trained LLM
•	Access to LLM and tailored applications
 Trained LLM also relies on three additional preparing stacks:
•	IT infrastructure for training
•	Huge training dataset
•	Neuronal networks based on “transformer” architecture
Model size in terms of number of parameters has been times by 15000 since the 
introduction of transformer architecture in 2017  
Consequently, training costs which increase according to the square of the number 
of parameters of the model has soared to hundreds of millions of $
Questions remains for the future model size, since computation capacity regular 
increase since decades has to overcome new physical barriers to continue
To reduce training costs and above all inference costs, lots of new models are 
built on a « Mix of Experts » architecture
The « mix of experts » architecture enables to significantly reduce inference 
costs while maintaining high level of performance
Powerful results of transformers applied to NLP have to extended to computer 
vision neuronal networks with vision transformer (VIT)
Access and apps industrialisation is leading to two main types of value propositions:
•	Turnkey solutions such as open AI chat GPT, Claude 3 Antropic, or Microsoft copilot
•	Toolbox solutions such as Llama 3, Mistral AI, Private GPT
APAIA TECHNOLOGY vision is that turnkey solutions are appropriated for initial 
individual use which do not involve private data, and that toolbox solutions are 
appropriated either for use involving private data or for medium to high level of 
use with automation expectations.

APAIA TECHNOLOGY vision of its impact on businesses:
Benefits of Generative AI are expected to be  two-fold: through both improvements 
in productivity, and  fundamental changes to customer value proposition.
By automating or augmenting  repetitive tasks, Generative AI models can  unlock cost 
benefits in back office  processes, and/or revenue growth  via improvements in service  
delivery, personalization, or customer experience.
By synthesizing large volumes of  complex data, Generative AI models can  enable new 
offerings; while some  industries likely to remain  unaffected, many will benefit from  
complementary offerings and others may be exposed to new competition.
Business functions that will likely see extensive or  eventually full automation, 
resulting in one or more of cost reductions, demand generation  due to via higher 
quality service, or ability to  focus resources on higher-value tasks are :
•	Marketing & advertising
•	Customer service
•	Legal
•	Software development
•	Research services & knowledge management
Businesses whose offerings can be entirely replaced with Generative AI services, 
being both undifferentiated / commoditized and not dependent on making or tracking a 
change in a  customer's physical environment are:
•	Translation services
•	Personal assistants, Chatbots
•	Public information aggregators
•	Fact-based reporting (e.g., sports results)



APAIA Technology mission in that context:
Our mission is to democratize generative AI, making it accessible and affordable 
for every business. We are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI to simplify 
and enhance business functions that are highly impacted from all industries. We are 
also helping businesses whose offerings can be entirely replaced with Generative AI 
services adapting their strategy and implementing new services.

#### Customer-Centric Innovation

Our commitment extends beyond technological advancements; APAIA TECHNOLOGY stands as 
a customer-centric company at its core. We believe in building strong relationships 
with our clients, focusing on understanding and meeting their needs with precision 
and empathy. This approach ensures that our innovations are not only cutting-edge but 
also deeply relevant and valuable to our community.

#### A Culture of Excellence

At APAIA TECHNOLOGY, fostering excellence is integral to our ethos. We are committed 
to upholding the highest standards in every aspect of our operations, from the AI 
solutions we design and develop to the support we provide to our stakeholders. Our 
dedication to quality shapes our workplace, encouraging our team to strive for 
excellence and deliver outstanding results.

#### A Vibrant and Creative Workspace

APAIA TECHNOLOGY is more than just a workplace; it is a hub of creativity and innovation. 
We champion a fun and engaging environment where new ideas flourish. Our team members 
are encouraged to think boldly and creatively, experimenting with new concepts in a 
supportive and dynamic setting. At APAIA TECHNOLOGY, every day is an opportunity to 
innovate and inspire.

Together, we are creating a future where AI enhances every aspect of the design process, 
making it faster, more efficient, and infinitely more creative. Join us on this exciting 
journey as we continue to innovate, empower, and lead in the generative AI space.
