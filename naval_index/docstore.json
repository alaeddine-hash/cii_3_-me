Our expertise in LLM and generative AI, \nsupported by a team of business consultants, data scientists and AI experts, makes us \nthe partner of choice.\n\nOur Generative AI offering covers 4 areas:\n    Identification and ideation: Identification of high value-added use cases, combining \nyour needs with the new possibilities offered by Generative AI, \n\n\tPrioritisation of business cases and drawing up of a roadmap\n\tTraining and acculturation: workshops on generative AI for leadership teams, LLMs, digital solutions, etc.\n\tTechnical management: selecting the best technical solutions to meet company\u2019s needs\n\tIndustrialisation of use cases: development and industrialisation of the use cases identified during the identification mission.\n\n\nUse cases implemented by AI thanks to generative AI include leveraging private knowledge base, understanding and analysing unstructured data from vertical market (market intelligence, customer needs and comments, plans, regulatory documents, etc.), increasing productivity (content generation, automation, etc.), solving complex problems, designing complex plans and products (industrial blueprints, technical components, etc.), improving customer relationships, cyber security, etc.\n\n\tExample 1: APAIA Technology is reshaping the landscape of digital design and security with its innovative product offerings. Our fully integrated SaaS platform, built around Stable Diffusion, is a game-changer for professionals in design and architecture. This platform not only automates the production of finely tuned models but also eliminates the need for coding, making advanced AI tools accessible to everyone. Additionally, we offer specialized LoRa plugins within the platform, designed specifically to enhance the workflows of designers and architects, whether they are working on indoor or outdoor projects.\n\n\tExample 2: Beyond design solutions, APAIA has developed an advanced semantic AI search agent capable of handling vast datasets. This robust platform operates independently from LLMs, allowing for seamless integration with both open-source models installed on-premises and large proprietary language models hosted in the cloud. This versatility ensures that users can leverage powerful search capabilities tailored to their specific needs and environments.  One of the applications made possible by this platform is the ability to create customized chatbots using your own data with a 100% data privacy compliance. Do you need to sift through multiple reports spanning over a hundred pages for specific information? Have thousands of customer support emails from which you\u2019d like to extract insights? Or perhaps you wish to make your company\u2019s knowledge base more accessible to your employees? In all these scenarios, a personalized chatbot could significantly boost your productivity. These chatbots rely on \u2018Question Answering,\u2019 a natural language processing (NLP) technique that facilitates interactive dialogue with textual documents. Regardless of the document\u2019s format\u2009\u2013\u2009be it PDF, Word, PowerPoint, etc.\u2009\u2013\u2009the chatbot can answer your queries, citing the exact sources from which it derived its response. APAIA leverages its technical expertise to provide chatbot that offers the best possible performance, ensuring its responses are both comprehensive and relevant.\n\n\tExample 3: in the realm of cybersecurity, APAIA stands out with its unique products that utilize the advanced capabilities of LLMs for security analysis. We have developed comprehensive tools for vulnerability assessment and action planning, which are essential for securing IT systems. These products provide in-depth insights and proactive solutions to help businesses safeguard their digital infrastructure against emerging threats.\n\nTogether, these business cases form a robust portfolio that places APAIA Technology\n at the cutting edge of AI application in design, content management, and cybersecurity, \n empowering our clients to lead in their respective fields with innovation and confidence.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4194, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7431b55-cafb-4572-bb2d-85214119a23f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7431b55-cafb-4572-bb2d-85214119a23f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ubuntu/cii_3_-me/Data/Vision.txt", "file_name": "Vision.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5385, "creation_date": "2024-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a32bfd6-8b71-4075-9fb9-b4975faecddb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ubuntu/cii_3_-me/Data/Vision.txt", "file_name": "Vision.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 5385, "creation_date": "2024-05-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-22"}, "hash": "0aac6d5080b702e0f1d514e8ae3abe5a6dc2d7c8844cd179fe0fac4a6f62372e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "155a3463-fbcf-47f8-92b1-df0c3923c171", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "698798e4ba7a9c2ec27a1c2ed265ed59e5000ed56547d37274bdbf01418811c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "__________________ VISION _& MISSION____________________\n\n\nAPAIA vision of the technology:\n\nGenerative AI, which development follows a typical disruptive innovation curve, has entered the acceleration phase since 2019 with 5 key drivers :\n\n\tPlatform industrialization\n\n\tMix of expert architecture\n\n\tSpreading of transformer architecture to computer vision\n\n\tAccess and tailored applications development\n\n\tCalculation capacity continuous increase\n\nGenarative AI relies on 3 articulated stacks:\n\n\n\tIT infrastructure for inference\n\n\tTrained LLM\n\n\tAccess to LLM and tailored applications\n Trained LLM also relies on three additional preparing stacks:\n\n\tIT infrastructure for training\n\n\tHuge training dataset\n\n\tNeuronal networks based on \u201ctransformer\u201d architecture\n\n\nModel size in terms of number of parameters has been times by 15000 since the \nintroduction of transformer architecture in 2017  \nConsequently, training costs which increase according to the square of the number \nof parameters of the model has soared to hundreds of millions of $\nQuestions remains for the future model size, since computation capacity regular \nincrease since decades has to overcome new physical barriers to continue\nTo reduce training costs and above all inference costs, lots of new models are built \non a \u00ab Mix of Experts \u00bb architecture\nThe \u00ab mix of experts \u00bb architecture enables to significantly reduce inference costs \nwhile maintaining high level of performance\nPowerful results of transformers applied to NLP have to extended to computer vision \nneuronal networks with vision transformer (VIT)\n\n\nAccess and apps industrialisation is leading to two main types of value propositions:\n\n\tTurnkey solutions such as open AI chat GPT, Claude 3 Antropic, or Microsoft copilot\n\n\tToolbox solutions such as Llama 3, Mistral AI, Private GPT\n\nAPAIA vision is that turnkey solutions are appropriated for initial individual use \nwhich do not involve private data, and that toolbox solutions are appropriated either \nfor use involving private data or for medium to high level of use with automation \nexpectations.\n\n\n\n\nAPAIA vision of its impact on businesses:\nBenefits of Generative AI are expected to be  two-fold: through both improvements in \nproductivity, and  fundamental changes to customer value proposition.\nBy automating or augmenting  repetitive tasks, Generative AI models can  unlock cost \nbenefits in back office  processes, and/or revenue growth  via improvements in service  \ndelivery, personalization, or customer experience.\nBy synthesizing large volumes of  complex data, Generative AI models can  enable new \nofferings;
